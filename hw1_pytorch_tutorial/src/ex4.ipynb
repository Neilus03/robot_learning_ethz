    "# Exercise 4: Transformers on Images + GLU-MLP Ablations (ViT × GLU Variants)\n",
    "\n",
    "## In this exercise you will combine two influential ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vision Transformers (ViT) from “An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale” (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929 :\n",
    "ViT shows that you can treat an image like a sequence of tokens by splitting it into non-overlapping patches (e.g. 16×16 in the paper), embedding each patch into a vector, adding positional information, and then applying standard Transformer blocks for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gated MLPs (GLU variants) from “GLU Variants Improve Transformer” (Shazeer, 2020) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05202 :\n",
    "Shazeer proposes replacing the standard Transformer feed-forward layer (FFN/MLP) with gated linear unit (GLU) variants such as GEGLU and SwiGLU, which often improves training dynamics and final performance under comparable compute/parameter budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will do\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement a tiny ViT-style classifier for MNIST, then run a controlled ablation where you replace the MLP inside each Transformer block:\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline FFN (GELU):\n",
    "Linear(d_model → d_ff) → GELU → Linear(d_ff → d_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "GLU-family MLPs (choose at least two and justify):\n",
    "\n",
    "GEGLU, SwiGLU, other activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to evaluate whether these GLU variants change:\n",
    "\n",
    "- convergence speed (loss vs steps),\n",
    "\n",
    "- final test accuracy,\n",
    "\n",
    "- and/or stability across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key ViT concepts you will implement\n",
    "\n",
    "- To convert MNIST images into Transformer tokens, you will:\n",
    "  Patchify each 28×28 image into non-overlapping P×P patches.\n",
    "  If P=4, then you get a 7×7 patch grid → 49 tokens per image.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embed patches with a linear layer: patch vectors → d_model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add positional embeddings so the model knows where each patch came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply n_layers Transformer encoder blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pool token features (e.g., mean pooling) and project to 10 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key GLU concept you will implement\n",
    "\n",
    "GLU-style MLPs replace a standard FFN with a gating mechanism:\n",
    "compute two projections a and b, apply a nonlinearity to a (variant-dependent), multiply elementwise: act(a) * b, project back to d_model.\n",
    "To keep the comparison fair, use the 2/3 width rule from Shazeer.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we provide vs what you implement\n",
    "\n",
    "### We provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MNIST loading + dataloaders\n",
    "\n",
    "- a minimal training loop structure (AdamW)\n",
    "\n",
    "- a suggested small model configuration that runs on CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "### You implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- patch tokenization (patchify)\n",
    "\n",
    "- patch embedding + positional embedding strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- a pre-LN Transformer encoder block using nn.MultiheadAttention\n",
    "\n",
    "- at least two GLU MLP variants + one FFN baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "- metric logging sufficient to support your conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Run at least 3 variants (baseline + the activation functions you choose for GLU) and report:\n",
    "\n",
    "- final and best test accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of trainable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- a plot or printed summary of loss/accuracy over epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "- a short discussion of your results"
